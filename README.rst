Repo from the PhIMaL group which contains some quality-of-life functions.


Description
===========


This repo contains a bunch of stuff to make your life easier, notably:
  * Tensorboard to pandas converter for easy analysis
  * Dataset class for data with analytical solutions, so that we can calculate the library analytically and see how
well deepmod has calculated it. As of writing, there's diffusion and a few different initial conditions for Burgers. The dataset class also makes a deepmod ready dataset. Loading numerical data will come in future release.
